This latter issue is why you can see mention of \"packer tasks\" and the \"Dunbrack rotamer library.\" pyRosetta is scanning through a library of rotamers, or statistically-preferred sidechain conformers, to determine the set that leads to ideal packing of the protein fold in the regions where sidechains need to be inferred.\n",
