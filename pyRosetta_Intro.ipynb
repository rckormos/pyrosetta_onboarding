    "pyRosetta is a useful tool for modelling and manipulating protein structures, so in order to make use of it we will need to load in a protein! For this exercise we will use the <i>de novo</i> designed protein Co-LOCKR from Lajoie et al. (2020), which exhibits switching behavior between two states. The authors have deposited the structure to the RCSB (the U.S.-based host of the Protein Data Bank) with the four-letter accession code 7JH5. We will load it using the pyRosetta function `pose_from_rcsb`."

This latter issue is why you can see mention of \"packer tasks\" and the \"Dunbrack rotamer library.\" pyRosetta is scanning through a library of rotamers, or statistically-preferred sidechain conformers, to determine the set that leads to ideal packing of the protein fold in the regions where sidechains need to be inferred.\n",
